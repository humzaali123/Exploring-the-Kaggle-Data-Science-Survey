# Exploring-the-Kaggle-Data-Science-Survey
Discover what top tools Kaggle participants use for data science and machine learning.

This Project was completed on DataCamp.

# Project Description

When beginning a career in data science, one often wonders what programming tools and languages one should learn first and what is being used in the industry. By exploring the 2017 Kaggle Data Science Survey results, you can learn about the tools used by 10,000+ people in the professional data science community.

To explore this project, students should be familiar with dataframes, dplyr, tidyr, and ggplot2. This project uses a subset of the 2017 Kaggle Machine Learning and Data Science Survey dataset.

Before starting this project you should be comfortable manipulating data frames and have some experience working with the tidyverse packages dplyr, tidyr, and ggplot2.
